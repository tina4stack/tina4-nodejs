# Changelog

Tina4 keeps ONE version across all four frameworks (Python, PHP, Ruby, Node.js), so a version
number means the same thing everywhere.

**The authoritative release notes for every shipped version live in the documentation:**
https://tina4.com/nodejs/36-releases

This file is deliberately NOT a copy of those notes. Duplicating them is exactly how a
changelog rots into claiming a version that was never cut, so this file records only
UNRELEASED work. When a version ships, its notes go to the release notes above.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Internal: the SQL dialect-translation module is renamed
  `packages/orm/src/sqlTranslation.ts` -> `packages/orm/src/sqlTranslator.ts`, so the filename
  matches the `SQLTranslator` class it exports (and the sibling frameworks). Consumers import the
  class by name from the package barrel (`export { SQLTranslator, QueryCache }`), and no exports
  map ever pointed at the file path, so this is a filename alignment with no API change.

### Fixed

- **`tina4 deploy docker` produced images that could not start.** Of the eight
  Dockerfile generators in the stack (four templates in the `tina4` CLI plus one
  in each framework's own CLI), exactly one was correct. Python named
  `python -m tina4_python.cli`, a package with no `__main__.py`, so the container
  died on startup; PHP ran `php index.php <addr>`, but `App::run(?host, port)`
  never reads argv so the address was dropped and production never engaged;
  Node named a path that exists only inside the tina4-nodejs monorepo and
  depended on tsx, which `npm ci --omit=dev` strips. Every generator now names a
  published entry point and requests production. Verified by scaffolding,
  generating, building and running a container for all four languages.
- **`serve` no longer kills PID 1.** The port-reclaim step read `lsof -ti`
  without validating it. Where lsof prints a different shape, a non-numeric field
  coerced to 0 or 1 -- and signalling PID 0 hits every process in the caller's
  own process group. In a container the server IS PID 1, so it killed itself
  (Node logged "Killed existing process on port 7148 (PID: 1 ...)" then exited
  143; PHP logged the same attempt and survived by luck). Reclaiming is now
  skipped inside a container, only all-digit PIDs are accepted, and PID 0, PID 1
  and the current process are never signalled.
- **The npm package ships built JavaScript.** `bin` pointed at a shell script
  running `npx tsx src/bin.ts`, and the package published TypeScript sources
  only -- so a production container had to fetch tsx from the network at start.
  `bin` is now `packages/cli/dist/bin.js`, a self-contained bundle importing only
  Node built-ins; `prepublishOnly` guarantees dist/ is in the tarball and
  `prepare` builds it in a fresh checkout. Verified with `--network none`.
